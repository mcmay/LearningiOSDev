Added another collection view for favourite photos and a segue showing an individual photo, reusing photo collection view cell, photo data source and photo info view controller. Unable to automatically generate managed tags object due to error,  "multiple description access managed object". Not clear why every photo object has a tags array but cannot have unique tags of their own but share all tags in common.
